# Rock-Paper-Scissors-C-sharp-Program
A C# of Rock, Paper, Scissors that is played between the user and CPU

Description: A program where the user and CPU play against each other in a game of rock, paper, scissors. I put a lot of care and attention into making 
this program work and figuring out what works and what doesnt work in a simple game. The program is easy to execute with the intention of
being used as a reference or inspiration for future C# projects. Happy coding! :D
